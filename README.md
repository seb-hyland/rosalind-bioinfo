# Description
A collection of personal solutions to [the Rosalind bioinformatics problem set](https://rosalind.info).

# Purpose
- Improve understanding of bioinformatics-related computational workflows
- Improve understanding of bioinformatics principles
- Build further familiarity with scientific computation tools and languages (Python and Julia)

# Prototype
- Building a REPL to interact with the collection
- Interact using a novel functional language
  - Currently under development, stub is in [this test Rust script](./repl.rs)
  - For past parsing work, see [Scroll's parsing implementation](https://github.com/seb-hyland/Scroll/blob/main/src/tools/scroll_processor.rs#L29)
